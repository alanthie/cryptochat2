recv() Error 4 Interrupted System Call - on RESIZE event
Error 4, or EINTR, is a common issue in socket programming, particularly when using blocking I/O calls like recv(). It occurs when a signal interrupts the system call, causing it to return prematurely with an error.

Causes:
Signal delivery: A signal (e.g., SIGALRM, SIGINT, SIGUSR1) is sent to the process while itâ€™s blocked in the recv() system call.
Timeouts: If a timeout is set for the socket (e.g., using setsockopt() with SO_RCVTIMEO), and the timeout elapses while waiting for data, recv() will return with EINTR.
System resource constraints: In some cases, system resource constraints (e.g., memory pressure, disk I/O) can cause the kernel to interrupt the system call.
Handling EINTR:

Retry the system call: The application should retry the recv() system call to continue waiting for data. This is the recommended approach, as it allows the system call to complete or timeout as intended.
Use non-blocking I/O: If possible, consider using non-blocking I/O (e.g., SO_NONBLOCK socket option) to avoid blocking and reduce the likelihood of EINTR.
Signal handling: Implement signal handlers to catch and ignore signals that might interrupt the system call. However, this approach is generally not recommended, as it can lead to complex and error-prone code.
Example code:

To retry the system call, you can use a loop like this:

int err;
while ((err = recv(sock, buffer, length, flags)) < 0 && errno == EINTR) {
    // retry
}
if (err < 0) {
    // handle error
}

Additional tips:

Always check the return value and errno after a system call to determine the cause of the error.
Use perror() or strerror() to print a human-readable error message.
Consider logging or debugging the issue to identify the root cause.
In the context of the provided search results, the issue was likely caused by a signal interrupting the recv() system call in the PyTorch data loader. The solution was to retry the system call or use a non-blocking I/O approach.
